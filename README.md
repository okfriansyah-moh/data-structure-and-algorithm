This is the repository for learning and memorization about data structure and algorithm

Previously java used QuickSort for primitives and MergeSort for Objects. In the latest versions', java uses 'Dual-Pivot Quicksort' & 'TimSort'.
TIMSORT is a hybrid algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort. to learn more about TimSort & Dual-pivot quicksort check
