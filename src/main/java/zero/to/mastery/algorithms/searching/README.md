//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS because it start searching from the closest
parent first

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare,
BFS (DFS will take long time. )
Because the tree is deep its gonna 1 by 1.  
DFS will use recursion
and then its gonna take a long time because the solutions 
are rare

//If the tree is very wide:
DFS (BFS will need too much memory)
Kalo DFS low memory tapi hasilnya sama karena gk deep.

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree
DFS because hopefully the solutions quicker than bfs

//determining whether a path exists between two nodes
DFS

//Finding the shortest path
BFS
